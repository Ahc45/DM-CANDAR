## About

By default turretcss's print styles are formatted for `A4` page size with a margin of `1.5cm 2cm`. Print styles include making text `@black`, and removing backgrounds from elements by default. Links are displayed next to anchors using `:after` pseudo content.

### CSS

```scss
--print-page-size: A4;
--print-page-margin: 1.5cm 2cm;
```
